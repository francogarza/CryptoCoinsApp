# CryptoCoinsApp
An app for browsing the top crypto coins' current market value. 

## Project Enhancements
For this project, I will be adding several features to improve the software quality and expand my skills:
- **SwiftLint**: To promote consistent coding standards.
- **MVVM-C**: I have experience with MVVM. This will be my first time using a Coordinator pattern for navigation.
- **Unit Testing**: For all components to ensure functionality.
- **UI Testing**: To verify user interface interaction.
- **Swift Charts**: To display price history data. I have limited experience with this framework.

While I've read about these features, this will be my first time researching and applying them in a real project, which will improve the overall quality and maintainability of the app.

## Roadmap
- **Project Setup**: 
  - [x] Set up repository, SwiftLint, and project structure.
  - [x] Implement Coordinator for navigation management.
  
- **Core Functionality**:
  - [x] Build the networking layer to fetch data from CoinGecko.
  - [x] Create the Coin List UI with search functionality.
  - [x] Implement navigation from the list to a detailed coin view.
  
- **Coin Detail View**:
  - [x] Develop the detail view.
  - [x] Integrate Swift Charts to display price history.

- **Testing and Quality**:
  - [ ] Write unit tests for all components during development.
  - [ ] Constantly ensure coding standards with SwiftLint. 
  - [ ] Add UI testing.
  
## Stretch Goals
- **UserDefaults**: Implement a theme feature that allows users to toggle between light and dark mode, with their preference saved using UserDefaults.
